# Regular expressions

I consolidate my understanding of regular expressions by using Python to specify a pattern and carry out pattern.search and pattern.match commands to test if different strings satisfy the conditions in the pattern.

## Requirements

- Tested on Python version 3.12.7, which also pulled in pip (version 24.2)
